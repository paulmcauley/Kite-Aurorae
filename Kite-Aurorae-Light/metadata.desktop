Comment=Kite-Aurorae is a fork of the Classik theme, except with an Oxygen/Breeze-style diamond/kite-shaped restore button which fits in with the Breeze Application Style. A kite floats in the breeze and also makes your windows float! Kite-Light is a light version of the theme designed to be used with the Breeze Light Colour Scheme.
