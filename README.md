# Kite-Aurorae
A branch of Classik-Aurorae theme for KDE Plasma, except with a kite-like restore button to float in the Breeze!

For details see https://www.pling.com/p/1482837/

If possible, use the binary theme instead at http://github.com/paulmcauley/classik This has better performance, inherits system titlebar colours properly and has an Application Style as well as a Window Decoration so that icons in dockable panels match the titlebar icons.
